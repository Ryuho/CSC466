The .java files we turned in are:
Csv.java  EvaluateCFList.java  EvaluateCFRandom.java  
Item.java  jester-data-1.csv  Pair.java  Query.java  User.java


To compile them:
javac EvaluateCFRandom.java *.java
javac EvaluateCFList.java *.java


To run them:
Have jester-data-1.csv in the same directory as the compiled .class files
java EvaluateCFRandom <method> <size>
java EvaluateCFList <method> <fileName>


the method options are as follows:
1. Mean Utility
2. Mean Utility with rank
3. Adjusted Weighted Sum
4. Adjusted Weighted Sum with rank
5. Adjusted Weighted Sum with transformed vote


We implemented:
 - Mean Utility function
 - Mean Utility function with rank
 - Adjusted Weighted Sum
 - Adjusted Weighted Sum with rank
 - getRank function, to return the top N Users that are similar to a given user
 - Adjusted Weighted Sum with transformed vote
 
The soft copy will be in a pdf format.
