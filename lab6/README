Weighting methods - TFIDF
Similarity score is consine simularity

Cosine simularity is not very good at getting queries sometimes.

in compilation, there will be warnings about the use of a Sun propriatary API. It works so ignore this. 
stopwords-onix.txt must be in teh same directory as the source folders

TO COMPILE
javac ir.java *.java

TO RUN
java ir

Extra Credit:
We implemented Okapi as well as TFIDF, both the functions
will be run automatically without any extra arguments.
