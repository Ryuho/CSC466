The StateNeighbors dataset contains data on which states boarder each state.

The format of the data is as follows:

CA 0 , AZ 0

The above means that CA and AZ share a boarder, all the numbers will be 0.

The format is meant to be similar to the NCAAFootball.txt so that you only need to write one parser.
